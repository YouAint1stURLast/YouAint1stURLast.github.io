		<p class="company_history">Ricky Bobby Industries was established in August of 2006 after Ricky Bobby rediscovered his speed while hurtling down the freeway in a classic American muscle car. It's the classic story of how a man fleed the police thinking he had a kilo of Colombian bam bam straped to the bottom of his car. Soon after evading the police Ricky Bobby decided to pursue a career in classic American muscle car sales.</p>
